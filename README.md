# Project-One-Clocks-Code-
8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project is a simple time management program written in C++. It provides two clock formats - a 12-hour format and a 24-hour format - and allows users to add hours, minutes, and seconds to each clock separately. The program helps users keep track of time by displaying both clock formats and allowing them to add time as needed.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I think the program's structure is easy to follow and understand. The menu system is straightforward, and each option is labeled clearly. I also like how I've separated the code into different functions, making it easier to read and maintain.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could enhance the code by adding error checking to the user input. Currently, the program assumes that the user will input the correct option number when presented with a menu. Adding error checking would prevent the program from crashing or displaying incorrect information if the user enters an invalid input.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I didn't find any part of the code particularly challenging to write. However, I did have to do some research on how to format the output of the time values. Stack Overflow is a great resource for troubleshooting common programming issues.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project has helped me develop my skills in object-oriented programming and problem-solving. It has also helped me practice working with user input and creating a menu-based interface. These skills will be transferable to other projects and coursework that involve creating programs with user input.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made the program maintainable by breaking down the code into smaller and ensuring that each function performs a single, well-defined task. I also added comments to each function to explain what it does and how it works. Finally, I also made the program adaptable by providing options for both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats and allowing users to add time to each clock separately.
